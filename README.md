# espairqual
espairqual is an esphome interface for PMSx003 and Panasonic NA-GCJA5 particulate matter (PM) sensors.

It offers a plug and play solution to integrate air quality monitoring with home assistant.

It can be powered by USC-C, or, by a wider range of input voltages on the screw terminals. It was designed for 24VAC, but will likely work with a slightly broader range
of both AC and DC input voltages. The absolute maximum voltage for the switching regulator is 40VDC, which means up to around 28VAC. The minimum DC is approximately 9VDC.

The PCB will fit inside a Hammond 1593ARBK case.
