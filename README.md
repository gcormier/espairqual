# espairqual
espairqual is an esphome interface for PMSx003 particulate matter (PM) sensors.

It offers a plug and play solution to integrate air quality monitoring with home assistant.

It can be powered by USC-C, or, by a wider range of input voltages on the screw terminals. It was designed for 24VAC, but will likely work with a slightly broader range
of both AC and DC input voltages. The absolute maximum voltage for the switching regulator is 40VDC, which means up to around 28VAC. The minimum DC is around 9VDC, and AC will require not only a higher voltage but also larger capacitors if you are powering it near this bottom end range.
